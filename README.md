# Adam's Embedded Utility Library

This is a collection of utility code that I use in some of my other projects.

At the moment this includes some things like:
* Portable logging functions
* A minimal unit test framework
* Some basic C++ data types similar to those in the standard library, for use
  in environments where the standard library is not available.
